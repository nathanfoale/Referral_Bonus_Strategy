#eToro Referral Bonus Strategy

# This section of the code calculates and displays the financial outcomes assuming you successfully 
# refer 10 people to the trading platform. It shows the total initial investment, referral bonus earnings, 
# withdrawn amount after investing $100 per person, the total return, and the net profit from these 10 referrals.

# Example calculations for 10 referrals

initial_investment_per_person <- 500

number_of_people <- 10
referral_bonus_per_person <- 200
withdrawal_fee_per_person <- 5
investment_in_stock <- 100


# Initial Investment 
total_initial_investment <- initial_investment_per_person * number_of_people


# Referral Bonus Reward
total_referral_bonus <- referral_bonus_per_person * number_of_people


# Amount Withdrawn
amount_withdrawn_per_person <- initial_investment_per_person - investment_in_stock - withdrawal_fee_per_person
total_withdrawn <- amount_withdrawn_per_person * number_of_people


# Total Return
total_return <- total_withdrawn + total_referral_bonus


# Net Profit
net_profit <- total_return - total_initial_investment
